# Disney.API
Disney API to retrieve data of the most famous characters and their movies!

Technologies used:
-WebAPI .NET Core 5.0
-Entity Framework Core
-Swagger
-SQL Server

In order to run the API with SQL Server, you need to run the actual migrations locally and add some data to the tables.
If you need to work with another DB (i.e PostgreSQL) you need the specific NuGet Package, change the DBContext and the ConnectionString in the AppSettings.
